# Mixed messages

Code Academy project to print randomized sentence. This implementation prints a random rpg encounter with the 3 variables being:

1. Location of the encounter
2. NPC encountered, dependent on location
3. Action taken by npc, dependent on npc

The corresponding NPC prints appropiate ASCII art in the second field. Some of the ASCII isn't centered due to the formatting it was taken from, but adjusting it is too much work...

Dont press before it is done displaying.
